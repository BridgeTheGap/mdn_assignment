    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2 id='ingredients'>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <h2 id='instructions'>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.
        <ul>
          <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
          <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
    </ol>

    <p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>

    <h2 id='storage'>Storage</h2>

    <p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    </p>

    <p>
    hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.

    This is just some <a href="https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=random+stuff" title="Not even worth clicking.">random stuff</a> that I'm going to ramble about. How many words that start with `r` did I just use right now?<br>
    Not so fast.<br>
    And here's a potato.

      How about a whole paragraph?<br>
      Maybe with two or more lines!
      </p>
    </a>

    <p>
    Let's try linking to <a href='#ingredients'>a specific part</a> of a document.<br>
    But before we do that, the document should be long enough so that the scroll offset would be past the part where the link is.<br>
    So let's just try to waste some good lines here... <br>
    Like this... <br>
    And this.. <br>
    And more.. <br>

    As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.

    “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...”

    “And when he died, I suddenly realized I wasn’t crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the backyard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. I’ve never gotten over his death. Often I think what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands? He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten million fine actions the night he passed on.”
