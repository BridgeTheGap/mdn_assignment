## 3. Styling Boxes

### Advanced Box Properties
- Width and height constraints
  - Maximum and minimum width constraints can be set like so:

    ```css
    width: 70%;
    max-width: 1280px;
    min-width: 480px;
    ```
    - When using percentage with `margin` and/or `padding`, it's the fraction of the containing block element. If one percentage value is specified only, the `width` of the containing block is used.

  - The container can be centered by adding the following:

    ```css
    margin: 0 auto;
    ```

  - This technique can be used on media to constrain sizes.

- Changing the box model
  - In the default box model, the total width of a box is the sum of `width`, `padding-left`, `padding-right`, `border-left`, and `border-right`.
  - By setting the `box-sizing` property to `border-box`, the value of `width` specifies the size of the outer border.

- Box Display Types
  - Common values for the `display` property
    - `block`: Content before and after the box appears on a separate line. Width and height can be set. The box model described earlier.
    - `inline`: Flows with the document's text. Width and height cannot be set. Any padding, margin, and border set on `inline` boxes will update the position of the surrounding text, but not `block` boxes.
    - `inline-block`: Flows like an `inline` box, but doesn't break with the paragraph line. Width and heigth can be set.
  - By default, block level elements have `display: block` set on them, while inline elements have `display: inline` set.
  - Other values
    - `table`: Allows you to emulate table layouts using non-table elements.
    - `flex`: Allows flexible layout.
    - `grid`: Gives CSS a native way of easily implementing grid systems.

### Backgrounds
- The default scope of a background is the content, padding, and border. The margin area doesn't count as part of the element's area.
- Properties that can be manipulated
  - `background-color`
  - `background-image`
  - `background-position`
  - `background-repeat`
  - `background-attachment`: Specifies the behavior of an element's background when its content scrolls; e.g. does it scroll with the content or is it fixed?
  - `background`: A shorthand for the five properties above.
  - `background-size`: Allows dynamic resizing of the background image

- The basics
  - `background-color`
    - The default is `transparent`.
    - Since some properties might not be supported by an older browser or the background images might fail to load, it's best practice to set the fallback background color.
  - `background-image`
    - You can fetch a static file using `url(path);`.
    - When images are smaller than the element size, it repeats by default.
    - Any image format that HTML images support is usable, including SVG.
    - Since CSS is only concerned about presentation, not content, these images are invisible to assistive technologies. Any content-related images must be loaded in HTML using the `<img>` element.
  - `background-repeat`
    - `repeat`: Repeats horizontally and vertically.
    - `no-repeat`
    - `repeat-x`: Repeats horizontally only.
    - `repeat-y`: Repeats vertically only.
  - `background-position`
    - With the top-left corner as origin, the property generally takes two values separated by a space.
    - Accepts...
      - Absolute values such as `px`
      - Relative values such as `em`, `rem`
      - Percentages such as `%`
      - Keywords: Takes `left`, `center`, `right`, and `top`, `center`, `bottom` respectively.

- Gradients
  - Linear and radial gradients are available
  - Linear gradient example
    
    ```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(`direction`, `begin_color`, `end_color`);
    ```
    - Direction
      - Keywords: `to bottom`, `to right`, `to bottom right`, etc.
      - Degreee values: `90deg`, `0deg`, etc.
    - Color stops example

    ```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, yellow, orange 40%, yellow);
    ```
      - You can specify as many color stops as you like.
      - Other units can be used to specify stop locations.

    - Repeated gradients example

    ```css
    background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, yellow, orange 25px, yellow 50px);
    ```

- `background-attachment`
  - `scroll`: Fixes the background to the viewport, so the background scrolls with the page, not the element.
  - `fixed`: The background stays in the fixed position regardless of the page scroll or the element scroll position.
  - `local`: Fixes the background to the element it is set on.
  - This property only has an effect when there is content to scroll.

- Multiple backgrounds
  - Since IE9 multiple backgrounds are supported.
  - Background definitions are separated with commas like so:

    ```css
    background: url(image.png) no-repeat 99% center,
                url(background-tile.png),
                linear-gradient(to bottom, yellow, #dddd00 50%, orange);
    background-color: yellow;  /* fallback background color */
    ```

  - Multiple backgrounds are stacked on top of each other, with the first definition appearing at the top.
  - Multiple values can be placed into longhand `background-*` properties like so:

    ```css
    background-image: url(image.png), url(background-tile.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
    ```

### Borders
- Default values for the border color and width are the color of the text and 3px respectively.
- `border-radius`
  - Supported in IE 9+.
  - Shorthand example

    ```css
    /* 1st value is top left and bottom right corners,
       2nd value is top right and bottom left  */
    border-radius: 20px 10px;
    /* 1st value is top left corner, 2nd value is top right
       and bottom left, 3rd value is bottom right  */
    border-radius: 20px 10px 50px;
    /* top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left */
    border-radius: 20px 10px 50px 0;
    ```

  - The x-radius and the y-radius can be set separately using a slash like so:

    ```css
    border-radius: 10px / 20px;
    border-radius: 10px 30px / 20px 40px;
    ```

- `border-image`
  - Supported in IE 11+.
  - Border properties needs to be specified in order for the border image to appear. This is also good as a fallback.
  - If you don't want the `background-color` property to be applied where the border image is, you might need to constraint the background like so: `background-clip: padding-box;`.
  - `border-image-source` should be set. The `url()` function can be used as in `background-image`.
  - `border-image-slice`
    - The border image is sliced into 9 parts, where the corner slices are used in corners and the slide slices are repeated or stretched.
    - One value: The image is sliced in equal sizes.
    - Two values: Top and bottom, left and right.
    - Three values: Top, left and right, bottom.
    - Four values: Top, right, bottom, left.
    - The values are interpreted as pixels for raster graphics and coordinates for vector graphics.
    - Percentages can also be used.
    - The center piece is discarded by default. If the center piece is needed, use the keyword `fill` in the `border-image-slice`/`border-image` value.
  - `border-image-repeat`
    - `stretch`
    - `repeat`: Image fragments are not adjusted.
    - `round`: Images are stretched slightly so that no fragments appear.
    - `space`: Images are placed with margins in-between so that no fragments appear. Supported in Safari 9+ and IE 11+.
  - `border-image-width`
  - `border-image-outset`: Adds space between the border and the padding.
  - Shorthand: `border-image: $(source) $(slice) $(repeat)`.

### Tables
- Best practice
  - Make the table markup as simple as possible and flexible, e.g. by using relative units.
  - `table-layout: fixed;`: This allows for better control over the table by sizing each column according to the heading; i.e. `width` properties of `<th>` elements. [Link](https://css-tricks.com/fixing-tables-long-strings/)
  - `border-collapse: collapse;`: Removes the margin outside of each cell border.
  - Use `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` to break up the table, allowing for finer customization.

### Advanced Box Effects
- Box shadows
  - `box-shadow` is available in IE 9+.
  - Shorthand: `box-shadow: $(h_offset) $(v_offset) $(blur_radius) $(base_color);`
  - Multiple shadows can be cast on a single box by providing multiple comma-separated `box-shadow` values.
  - The `inset` keyword: Putting this at the start of a shadow declaration causes it to become an inner shadow.
  - `spread radius` causes the shadow to become bigger than the original box.

### Filters
- Filters can be applied to any element, block, or inline.
- The `drop-shadow()` function casts shadow on the content inside the box as well as the border.
- Filters are not supported in IE.
- Some browsers may require a vendor-prefixed version of filter; i.e. `-webkit-filter:`.

### Blend mode
- Two properties use blend modes
  - `background-blend-mode` blends together multiple background images and colors set on a single element.
  - `mix-blend-mode` blends together both background and content the element it is set on with elements it is overlapping.
- Blend modes are not supported by Edge and only partially supported by Safari.

- `webkit-background-clip: text;`
  - Example
  
    ```css
    .text-clip {
      -webkit-background-clip: text;
      -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
    }
    ```

  - Vendor-prefixed properties are *NOT* the standard.
