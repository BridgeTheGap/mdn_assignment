## 1. Intro to CSS

### CSS

- CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users
- Document: usually a text file structured using a markup language; e.g. HTML, SVG, XML
- CSS Rules
  - Properties: Human-readable identifiers indicating which features are to be changed (e.g. `background-color`)
  - Values: Values for properties tell how the stylistic features are to be applied. (e.g. `yellow`)
  - Declaration: A property/value pair of a CSS rule. A declaration is terminated using a semi-colon.
  - Selector: Selects which elements the declarations in the declaration block are to be applied to.

### DOM (Document Object Model)

- A browser combines the document's content with the style information in two stages:

  1. The browser loads and parses HTML and CSS into a DOM tree.
  2. The browser displays the contents of the DOM.

- DOM

  - Has a tree-like structure.
  - Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node.
  - Nodes have parents, children, and siblings.
  - Understanding DOM is important because that's where CSS style is applied.

- DOM representation example

  - HTML

    ```html
    <p>
      Let's use:
      <span>Cascading</span>
      <span>Style</span>
      <span>Sheets</span>
    </p>
    ```

  - DOM representation

    ```
    P
    ├─ "Let's use:"
    ├─ SPAN
    |  └─ "Cascading"
    ├─ SPAN
    |  └─ "Style"
    └─ SPAN
       └─ "Sheets"
    ```

### Applying CSS to HTML

- External stylesheet
  - Referenced from an HTML `<link>` element
- Internal stylesheet
  - Could be useful when using CMS (content management system)
  - CSS is placed inside a `<style>` element, contained inside the HTML head.
  - Requires a lot of replicated code to have the same effect across different HTML documents
- Inline styles
  - Affects one element only by using the `style` attribute
  - **NOT** recommended: mixes content with presentation

### CSS Syntax

- Characteristics
  - CSS is a declarative language
  - Invalid CSS declarations are ignored.
- Declarations
  - The U.S. spelling for words have been set as standard. For example, `color` works but `colour` does not.
  - Declarations within a declaration block are separated with a semi-colon. The last declaration does not need one, but it is recommended.
  - A declaration block may be empty
  - Declaration blocks may be nested in some cases.
- Selectors
  - Selectors may include difrerent elements in a comma-separated list, and can be chained together.
  - Selectors can be used to target only certain elements in a certain context
  - When an element is matched by several selectors, CSS applies the styles according to the cascading algorithm.
  - If a single basic selector in a chain is invalid, the group of selectors is still valid.

### CSS Statements

- At-rules

  - Used to convey metadata, conditional information, or other descriptive information
  - Examples
    - Metadata: `@charset`, `@import`
    - Conditional information: `@media`, `@document`
    - Descriptive information: `@font-face`

- Nested statements

  - The nested CSS rules apply only when a specific condition is matched

    - `@media`: If the device that is running the browser matches the expressed condition
    - `@supports`: If the browser actually supports the tested feature
    - `@document`: If the current page matches some conditions

    - Example (CSS rule applied only if the page's width exceeds 800 pixels)

      ```css
      @media (min-width: 801px) {
        body {
          margin: 0 auto;
          width: 800 px;
        }
      }
      ```

- Any statement which is not a ruleset, an at-rule, or a nested statement is invalid and ignored.

### Other

- Comment: `/* comment */`
- Shorthand: Some properties allow you to set them all in one line. The following two blocks of declaration are the same.

  ```css
  padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;
  ```

  ```css
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 15px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
  padding-left: 5px;
  ```

### Selector

- Different types

  - Simple selectors: Match one or more elements based on element type, `class`, or `id`
  - Attribute selectors: Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values
  - Pseudo-classes: Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state; e.g. checkbox that is checked, the first child element of its parent in the DOM tree, etc.
  - Pseudo-elements: Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element; e.g. the first word of each paragraph.
  - Combinators: Not selectors per se, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways.
  - Multiple selectors: Comma-separated list of selectors to apply the same rule to a set of elements

- Simple selectors

  - A **case-insensitive** match between the selector name and a given HTML element name
  - Class selectors

    - Syntax: `.class-name`
    - A class name is any value without spaces, placed inside an HTML `class` attribute.
    - Different elements in a document can have the same class value, while one element can also have different class names.

  - ID selectors

    - Syntax: `#id-value`
    - An ID name must be unique in the document. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

  - Universal selector: `*`
    - Allows selecting all elements in a page
    - Rarely used on its own, often used in combination with other selectors

- Attribute selectors

  - Presence and value attribute selectors

    - Matches an exact attribute value
    - `[attr]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name regardless of its value
    - `[attr=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name and value
    - `[attr~=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name, but only if the value is one of a space-separated list of values contained in the attribute's value; e.g. a single class in a space-separated list of classes.

  - Substring value attribute selectors
    - a.k.a "RegExp-like selectors"
    - `[attr|=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name for which the value is exactly `val` or starts with `val-`
    - `[attr^=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name for which the value starts with `val`.
    - `[attr$=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name for which the value ends with `val`.
    - `[attr*=val]`: Selects all elements with the attribute name for which the value contains the string `val`. Does not treat spaces as value separators but as part of the attribute value.

- Pseudo-selectors

  - Selects certain parts of elements or elements only in certain contexts
  - Pseudo-classes

    - A keyword, preceded by a colon, added to the end of selectors to specify which state elements should be in in order for the style to be applied.

    ```css
    li:nth-of-type(2n) {
      background-color: #eee;
    }
    ```

  - Pseudo-elements
    - Keywords preceded by two colons(`::`). Can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element

- Combinators
  - Multiple selector
    - Syntax: `A, B`
    - Selects any element matching A and/or B
  - Descendant selector
    - Syntax: `A B`
    - Selects any element matching B that is a descendant of an element matching A
  - Child selector
    - Syntax: `A > B`
    - Selects any element matching B that is a direct child of an element matching A
  - Adjacent sibling selector
    - Syntax: `A + B`
    - Selects any element matching B that is the next sibling of an element matching A
  - General sibling
    - Syntax: `A ~ B`
    - Selects any element matching B that is one of the next siblings of an element matching A

### CSS values and units

- Numeric values

  - Absolute units
    - `mm`, `cm`, `in`
    - `pt`, `pc`: Points (1/72 of an inch) or picas (12 points)
  - Relative units
    - `em`
      - The most common relative unit
      - `1em` is the same as the font-size of the current element--the width of a capital letter M.
      - The default base `font-size` given to web pages by web browsers before CSS styling is applied is 16 pixels. However, font sizes are inherited from parent elements.
    - `ex`, `ch`: Respectively, the height of a lowercase x, and the width of number 0. Not supported well.
    - `rem`: Root `em`. Always equal the size of the default base `font-size`.
    - `vw`, `vh`: 1/100th or the viewport width and height respectively. Not as widely supported as `rem`s.
  - Unitless values
    - `margin` or `padding`: Setting these attributes to `0` will nullify whatever units were set before.
    - `line-height`: Sets the line height of text to the value multiplied to the `font-size`.
    - Animation count

- Percentages

  - Setting `div` element's width to a certain percentage will set that element width relative to its parent element width.
  - `font-size`: relative to the parent's `font-size`. Similar to `em`.
  - Liquid layout: Used to ensure that a standard document will always fit on the screen and look okay across varying device screen sizes.
  - Fixed width layout: Used when the content should not be affected by the viewport size; e.g. a zoomed map should not shrink relative to the viewport size.

- Colors

  - Keywords: 165 different keywords for colors
  - Hexadecimal values: `#value`
  - RGB: Uses the `rgb()` function
  - HSL: Hue, saturation, and lightness. Uses the `hsl()` function.
    - Hue: 0-360. The value is in degrees.
    - Saturation: Value between 0-100%.
    - Lightness: Value between 0-100%.
  - RGBA/HSLA: Supports the alpha channel, with a value between 0-1.
  - `opacity`: Sets the opacity of all selected elements and their children.

- Functions
  - `rgba()`, `hsl()` are functions
  - Other functions include: `rotate()`, `translate()`, `calc()`, `url()`, etc.

### Cascade and Inheritance

- The cascade

  - Three factors decide what selectors win out (in order of weight): importance, specificity, source order.

  - Importance

    - Example

      ```css
      <p
        class="better"
        > This
        is
        a
        paragraph.</p
        > <p
        class="better"
        id="winning"
        > One
        selector
        to
        rule
        them
        all!</p
        > #winning {
        background-color: red;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      .better {
        background-color: gray;
        border: none !important;
      }

      p {
        background-color: blue;
        color: white;
        padding: 5px;
      }
      ```

      1. The rules that appear later in the source code generally overrides earlier rules.
      2. However, a the two `<p>` elements in the example above will have a `background-color` that is not `blue` because the `class` attribute makes them more specific.
      3. `id` attributes have a higher specificity in that only one element to ID pair.
      4. Though `#winning` has a higher specificy than `.better` in general, the second `<p>` does not get a border because `!important` wins over all others.

    - Do **NOT** use `!important` unless it is absolutely necessary.

    - The importance of a CSS declaration depends on what stylesheet it is specified in
    - Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order:
      1. Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set)
      2. Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user)
      3. Normal declarations in author style sheets (set by web developers)
      4. Important declarations in author style sheets
      5. Important declarations in user style sheets

  - Specificity

    - A measure of how specific a selector is; i.e. how many elements it could match
    - Order of specificity: `!important` > ID > class > element

    - Values
      1. Thousands: `1` if declaration is inside a `style` attribute. Else `0`.
      2. Hundreds: `1` for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector. Else `0`.
      3. Tens: `1` for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
      4. Ones: `1` for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.
      5. The universal selector `*`, combinators (`+`, `>`, `~`, '') and negation pseudo-class `:not` have no effect on specificity.


      - Example

        ```css
        /* specificity: 0101 */
        #outer a {
          background-color: red;
        }

        /* specificity: 0201 */
        #outer #inner a {
          background-color: blue;
        }

        /* specificity: 0104 */
        #outer div ul li a {
          color: yellow;
        }

        /* specificity: 0113 */
        #outer div ul .nav a {
          color: white;
        }

        /* specificity: 0024 */
        div div li:nth-child(2) a:hover {
          border: 10px solid black;
        }

        /* specificity: 0023 */
        div li:nth-child(2) a:hover {
          border: 10px dashed black;
        }

        /* specificity: 0033 */
        div div .nav:nth-child(2) a:hover {
          border: 10px double black;
        }

        ```
    - Source order: Ties are broken according to appearance order in the source code

- Inheritance

  - Some property values applied to an element will be inherited by that element's children while some won't.
  - Common sense according to convenience is the rule of thumb.

  - Controlling inheritance: Three special universal property values for handling inheritance:
    1. `inherit`: The property value applied to a selected element is the same as that of its parent element
    2. `initial`: The property value applied to a selected element is the default value in the browser's default style sheet. If no value is specified in the default style sheet, the value is set to `inherit` instead.
    3. `unset`: Resets the property to its natural value; i.e. if the property is naturally inherited it acts like `inherit`, otherwise it acts like `initial`.

### The Box Model

- Box properties

  - `width` and `height`
    - The width and height of the content box.
    - Content includes both text content and other representing child elements.
  - `padding`
    - The inner space (inset) of a CSS box.
    - Padding can be set at once with the `padding` shorthand property or individually with `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left` properties.
  - `border`
    - The border of a CSS box spans from the outer edge of padding and the inner edge of the margin.
    - `border` is a shorthand property where `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` can be set at once.
    - `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left` sets the border thickness, style, and color individually.
    - Use `border-top-width`, `border-right-style`, `border-bottom-color` to set a single side border property.
  - `margin`
    - Surrounds a CSS box and pushes up against other CSS boxes.
    - The shorthand `margin` and `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left` are possible.

- Note on box properties

  - When two adjacent margins have a different value, only the bigger value is observed. The smaller margin is collapsed; i.e. `margin = max(boxA.margin, boxB.margin)`
  - When `margin`, `padding`, and/or `border` properties are set, the content area is decreased.
  - The default content `width` is set to 100% of the available space after the `margin`, `border`, and `padding` have been set.
  - The percentage value of `padding` or `margin` is relative to the containing element's value.
  - Margins can accept negative values.
  - Box content heights don't observe percentage lengths. They are set to the height of the box content if not set to an absolute height.
  - Borders ignore percentage width settings.
  - `box-sizing` property allows user to set the box size according to the external width: i.e. the left end of the border to the right end of the border.

- Overflow: When the content size to too small to fit the content, `overflow` property can be set to define the behavior in such cases:
  - `auto`: The overflowing content is hidden and scroll bars are shown
  - `hidden`: the overflowing content is clipped to the bounding box
  - `visible`: The overflowing content is spilled outside the box
- Background clip
  - Box backgrounds are made up of colors and images
  - By default, backgrounds extend to the outer edge of the border
  - `background-clip` can be assigned the following values: `border-box`, `padding-box`, and `content-box`
- Outline

  - Not part of the box model
  - Drawn outside the border box, inside the margin area, without changing the size of the box

- The `display` property

  - A `block` box is a box that's stacked upon other boxes.
  - An `inline` box is the opposite of a block box. Width and height settings have no effect on `inline` boxes. Any padding, margin, and border set on `inline` boxes will update the position of the surrounding text only.
  - An `inline-block` box does not create line breaks before and after the box, and it can be sized using `width` and `height`. Also, it won't break across paragraph lines to maintain its box-like figure.

- Inner and outer display types
  - The outer display types determine how the box is laid out in relation to other boxes.
  - The inner display types determine how boxes inside the box are laid out. The inner display type can be changed by using `display` values liek `flex`.

### Debugging

- Like HTML, CSS is permissive. If the browser encounters invalid CSS code, it just moves on to the next valid code.
- The DOM inspector and CSS editor can be helpful in debugging
- Use CSS validation

### Definitions
- Viewport: The visible area of the page in the browser.
